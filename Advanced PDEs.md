# 1st Week
In the first week, we introduced a special class of functions called Schwartz space. It includes functions whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing. This property gives us that the Fourier transform is an automorphism on this space. $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d):=\lbrace f\in\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d ; \mathbb{C})\rbrace: \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^d}|x^{\alpha} \partial^{\beta}f(x)|<\infty ,\forall \alpha , \beta \in \mathbb{N}_{0}^{d}\rbrace $ 
The member of Schwartz Space is called Schwartz function. The topology on $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is determined by seminorms 
$||f||_{\alpha ,k}:= \sum_{|\alpha|,|\beta|\leq k} \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^d}|x^{\alpha} \partial^{\beta}f(x)|$
